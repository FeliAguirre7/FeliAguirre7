I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, born on March 7, 2001, in Santiago Del Estero, a city in northern Argentina. My heart beats for the arts, and now I'm on an exciting journey exploring the world of programming to infuse my creativity with technology. Combining my love for artistic expression with the logic and innovation of programming, I graduated from the SoyHenry bootcamp, equipped with skills in JavaScript, React, Redux, Sequelize, Express, PostgreSQL, and more.

In my hometown Santiago del Estero, I've consistently pursued my passion for various forms of art, be it painting, music, or visual mediums. Embracing the challenge of integrating creativity with technology, my goal is to create unique solutions by merging the imaginative artist within me with the precision of programming.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, feel free to reach out!
💛 I'm a proactive, creative, optimistic, dedicated, decisive, and perfectionist individual.
